#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools in developing and maintaining high-quality software systems. Software engineering is important in the technology industry because enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C): The creation of high-level programming languages in the 1950s and 1960s made software development more accessible, efficient, and portable across different computer systems.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline: In the 1960s, the term "software engineering" was introduced to promote a more systematic, structured approach to developing complex software systems as they grew in scale and importance.
3. The advent of structured programming: In the 1970s, structured programming techniques emerged, emphasizing clear, logical control structures, which improved software readability, maintainability, and debugging by reducing reliance on unstructured code.
   
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases e.g., requirements, design, implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall.Example: Developing a large-scale banking system where the requirements are well-defined upfront and unlikely to change during the development process.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Example: Developing a mobile app for a startup, where customer feedback is frequently gathered, and the app's features evolve rapidly based on user needs and market trends.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse.
 Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
 Solution: Adopt Agile methodologies to incorporate flexibility
 Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
 Solution: Prioritize time management and break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
 Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
 Solution:: Regularly allocate time for refactoring code and ensuring that best practices are followed, rather than taking shortcuts.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software, ensuring that individual components or modules function correctly in isolation
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Ensures that different components or subsystems interact as expected, identifying issues that may arise when combining individual modules.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. This helps identify issues that may not be apparent during unit or integration testing, ensuring the system meets its overall requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.  It ensures that the software delivers the expected value to the end-users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. This helps avoid getting vague anserws from AI by making questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what is needed. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about cars.
Improved prompt: Explain the invention and innovation of cars throughout the years. 
Adding context helps the AI understand your request better and give more direct and clear answers.
